## JavaScript Expertise

I've demonstrated my JavaScript skills in creating this Rock Paper Scissors game:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** I've designed the app with a modular approach using React components to ensure better readability, reusability, and maintainability of code.

2. **State Management:** I've leveraged React's `useState` to manage the game state, including user and computer choices, scores, and winner determination.

3. **Random Choice Generation:** The computer's choice is generated randomly from an array of choices.

4. **Conditional Rendering:** I've used conditional rendering to display different components based on the game state, such as the start screen, game interface, and results.

5. **Event Handling:** I've effectively used event handlers to manage user interactions, such as clicking choices, starting the game, and resetting the game.
